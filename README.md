# SOAR-EDR Project

## Overview
This repository contains the SOAR-EDR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response for Endpoint Detection and Response) project influenced by **[MyDFIR]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWX19cpv21w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gs1pYJfWv7k))**. The playbook developed is designed to guide users through the process of handling security incidents, specifically focusing on isolating potentially compromised systems and communicating with users.

### Logical Flow  
1. **Event Logs**: The process begins when LimaCharlieâ€™s detection and response functions are triggered by specific event logs.  
2. **LimaCharlie Integration to SOAR**: The alert is integrated into the Tines (SOAR) platform to initiate a playbook.  
3. **Internal Communication**: The alert is automatically broadcast to communication platforms (Slack, Email).  
4. **User Prompt**: The SOC Analyst investigates the alert. A user prompt provides Boolean values to determine if endpoint isolation is needed.  
   - **Yes**: The computer is isolated, and an update is sent to communication platforms.  
   - **No**: The computer remains on the network, and an update is sent to communication platforms.  
5. **Message with Details**: A text box displays filtered information through playbook functions.

## Cloud OS Provisioning  
For this lab, a **Windows 2022 server** is implemented in the **Vultr cloud environment** to simulate an infected machine. Firewall configurations ensure that access to this VM is restricted to the host IP address via **Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) port 3389**.  

The purpose of accessing this device is to simulate a malicious actor gaining unauthorized access to run malicious scripts. In this project, the **Lazagne** script kiddie penetration testing tool (obtained from GitHub) is used to test EDR capabilities.

## Device Enrollment (LimaCharlie)  
Device enrollment is critical for monitoring and protecting endpoints. Two methods are recommended based on network size:  

### Manual Enrollment (Recommended for Small Networks)  
For small networks, manual enrollment is straightforward. This is done through the LimaCharlie platform:  
1. Use the **Installation Documentation** on the enrollment key page.  
2. Utilize the provided enrollment key to install the LimaCharlie agent on the endpoint device.  

### Automated Enrollment via Group Policy Objects (GPO) in Active Directory  
For larger networks, automate enrollment using **Group Policy Objects (GPO)** in Active Directory. This method allows simultaneous enrollment of multiple devices.  

---

## Configuration  
Once devices are enrolled, configure the following settings:  
- **Sensors and Detections**: Configure sensors to collect relevant data and set up detections for potential security incidents.  
- **Response Actions**: Define automated response actions for LimaCharlie to take when specific detections are triggered.  

For this lab, a **Windows 2022 server** was manually configured as the only endpoint.

## Tines Integration  
Tines is integrated to automate workflows and responses. This involves:  
- Developing workflows in Tines to automate responses to security incidents.  
- Configuring triggers to initiate automated actions based on specific criteria.  

### Developing a Playbook  
The playbook development process includes:  
1. **Incident Identification**: Define how incidents are identified and categorized.  
2. **Response Actions**: Outline steps to be taken in response to different types of incidents.  
3. **Communication Protocols**: Establish protocols for internal and external communication during an incident.
